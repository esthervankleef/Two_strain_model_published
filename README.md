# Two strain model 

This model simulates the transmission dynamics of a hospital adapted resistant strain and a community adapted sensitive strain in the hospital and community, and simulates the impact of a hand hygiene intervention on the incidence and prevalence of both strains. 

Model_functions.R contains all functions including the model, plotting functions and functions to calculate R0.

Run_model.R contains the code to run the model and generate output

plot_output.R contains the code to plot the model output.
