# Two strain model 

This model simulates the transmission dynamics of two competing strains, i.e. a hospital-adapted resistant strain and a community-adapted sensitive strain. 

It has been argued that since infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, should affect resistant and sensitive strains equally, 
observed discordant changes must have largely resulted from other factors, such as changes in antibiotic use. 
This model is used to test the validity of this reasoning.
